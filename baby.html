        <h1>My First HTML-Base Web</h1>
        <p>
            So, guess what, this is my first step of becoming a full-stack web developer. 
            I have so much fun on learning and meeting new people. Well, compared with some of my new
            friend in this course, I'm not that good, but for that reason, I will puch my way up there, 
            so I can become a great full-stack web developer, just like our teacher, Mr Ichsan, but He
            likes to be called icanq, I guess that is his secret name, hahaha, well I too have a lot of
            secret name, like <em>alexgodjirah<</em>, <em>alexgoz</em>, <em>albino</em>, etc, which sounds
            friendly and fun.
            <br></br>
            Since this is my first HTML web, I like to add some assets, like picture, video, etc, but since 
            I don't know what do I want to write, so I just write about my experience on learning to become a 
            full-stack web developer. P.S. It is not that I don't know what are the tags to show some assets, 
            but I just don't like to put on some random things, hahaha.
            <br><br>
            I hope this learning activty will become a great thing for me, of course it will, I hope I can do
            well on this course. And actually I kinda exited on learning about CSS programming language, since
            I love design, and the first challenge, since I love to explore my mind.
            <br></br>
            I think that's all for today, thank you for you time to ride this.
            <br></br><br></br>
            Actually, I want to type random shit, because it is fun to write hahaha.
